You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Semester-Long project on developing a framework to combat misinformation. Through this project, I learned both methodological skills and policy design.

{% for tag in site.tags %}
  <h3>{{ tag[0] }}</h3>
  <ul>
    {% for post in tag[1] %}
      <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endfor %}
